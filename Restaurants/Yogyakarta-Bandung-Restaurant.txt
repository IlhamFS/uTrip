Braga No. 58, Bandung 40111, Indonesia Location: Asia  >  Indonesia  >  Java  >  West Java  >  Bandung Phone Number: +62 22 4233778 THE PARIS OF JAVA At Maison Bogerijien, indulge in an ambience and menu that takes you back in time to the glorious days of Indonesia's colonial past. The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],

The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],

The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],

The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],

The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],

The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],

The paintings and pictures on the restaurant's walls reminisce of the \"Parijs Van Java\" period when Bandung lay at the heart of the Dutch East Indies and was home to a melange of grand hotels, restaurants, cafes and European boutiques. Combined, these pictures tell the story of Maison Bogerijen's links to Indonesia's rich Dutch heritage. A CENTURY OF MAISON BOGERIJEN Opened in 1918 by L. Van Bogerijen, Maison Bogerijen was first located on the east side of the Bragaweg and Oude Hospitalweg crossroads. Set in a typical townhouse of the time, the restaurant featured a dinning room that opened up to a garden sheltered by the canopy of two majestic trees. A symbol of the Kingdom of the Netherlands could be seen in the middle of the building and signs in French, such as \"glacier\", \"cuisinier\" and \"confiseur\", decorated parts of the roof. By 1923, the restaurant had moved to its present location at Braga Permai in Bragaweg. A MYRIAD CULTURES & CUISINES With its assortment of French, local Indonesian and Dutch delights, Maison Bogerijen soon became a popular favourite, with prominent figures in the Dutch Kingdom and the governor generals of the Dutch East Indies amongst its elite patrons. The restaurant served a menu of sweet goodies, including cakes, chocolates and ice creams, but it also served main dishes from different countries and cultures, providing a dining experience like no other. Loyal customers came from areas around Braga such as Coorde Alley, Spaarbank Alley, Telepfoon Alley, Bruyn & Thyssen Alley, Oude Hospitalaweg, Tamblongweg and more. They made their way to the back of the building daily to delight in the restaurant's special morning stall, which sold a selection of breads and cakes for a hearty breakfast. For customers living further away from Braga, the stall ran a delivery service until the late 1980s. FROM MAISON BOGERIJEN TO BRAGA PERMAI Journey with us in time as you dine in the Paris of Java. Treat yourself to our original authentic recipes such as ontbijkoek, booterstaf, ananas gebak and almond speculaas as well as a range of other dishes and desserts from around the world. Indulge too in the restaurant's colonial charm, which pays homage to its Indonesian and Dutch roots. Fragments of the old Maison Bogerijen such as the old kitchen, the room used to bake bread (including the old oven and mixer) and the residual gas pipe remain today to add to the charm. Today known as Braga Permai, the restaurant is a local favourite, treasured for serving up the best of both worlds. - a modern tribute to a time gone by Top-rated Attractions Nearby 1,190 Reviews Braga Street 112 Reviews Bank Indonesia Building 39 Reviews Braga City Walk Browse all attractions Top-rated Restaurants Nearby 61 Reviews Sumber Hidangan 42 Reviews May Star Restaurant 40 Reviews Wiki Koffie Browse all restaurants" ],
