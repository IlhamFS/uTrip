This little intimate Take away and Dine-in restaurant, with its rustic and beautiful plank tables and benches, has won critical acclaim for its juicy and crispy grilled chickens and Pork Spare ribs. In addition, a wide range of home made western salads and potato dishes. Our executive chef and owner for many years, Ni Ketut, ensures that our talented chefs use only fresh ingredients from the morning market. If local products do not meet our high quality standards, then we use imported raw materials such as Dairy products from France and olive oil from Italy or Spain. All meals are without MSG (Mono Sodium Glutamate). The kitchen is open every day from 12:00 until 21:00. We recommend booking of seats, take away or delivery.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl. Danau Tamblingan, No. 82, in front of the Besakih Hotel and Jamu Traditional Spa. As With Art Cafe Warung & Spa, Art Cafe Sanur is open every day, serving all day breakfast from 7AM to 5PM, together with lunch from noon onwards, and dinner from 5 PM to 11PM. Happy Hours are from 4 to 6 PM. We also provide free Internet connections and Wi-fi. For visitors who have sampled the beauty and ambiance of Sanur over the years, and for all our friends who have known us as Art Cafe Warung & Spa we look forward to welcoming you to the new Art Cafe Sanur. Our Leha Leha Spa will be opening at a separate location on Jl. Sudamala, later in the year.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl. Danau Tamblingan, No. 82, in front of the Besakih Hotel and Jamu Traditional Spa. As With Art Cafe Warung & Spa, Art Cafe Sanur is open every day, serving all day breakfast from 7AM to 5PM, together with lunch from noon onwards, and dinner from 5 PM to 11PM. Happy Hours are from 4 to 6 PM. We also provide free Internet connections and Wi-fi. For visitors who have sampled the beauty and ambiance of Sanur over the years, and for all our friends who have known us as Art Cafe Warung & Spa we look forward to welcoming you to the new Art Cafe Sanur. Our Leha Leha Spa will be opening at a separate location on Jl. Sudamala, later in the year.

Our executive chef and owner for many years, Ni Ketut, ensures that our talented chefs use only fresh ingredients from the morning market. If local products do not meet our high quality standards, then we use imported raw materials such as Dairy products from France and olive oil from Italy or Spain. All meals are without MSG (Mono Sodium Glutamate). The kitchen is open every day from 12:00 until 21:00. We recommend booking of seats, take away or delivery.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl.

This little intimate Take away and Dine-in restaurant, with its rustic and beautiful plank tables and benches, has won critical acclaim for its juicy and crispy grilled chickens and Pork Spare ribs. In addition, a wide range of home made western salads and potato dishes. Our executive chef and owner for many years, Ni Ketut, ensures that our talented chefs use only fresh ingredients from the morning market. If local products do not meet our high quality standards, then we use imported raw materials such as Dairy products from France and olive oil from Italy or Spain. All meals are without MSG (Mono Sodium Glutamate). The kitchen is open every day from 12:00 until 21:00. We recommend booking of seats, take away or delivery.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl. Danau Tamblingan, No. 82, in front of the Besakih Hotel and Jamu Traditional Spa. As With Art Cafe Warung & Spa, Art Cafe Sanur is open every day, serving all day breakfast from 7AM to 5PM, together with lunch from noon onwards, and dinner from 5 PM to 11PM. Happy Hours are from 4 to 6 PM. We also provide free Internet connections and Wi-fi. For visitors who have sampled the beauty and ambiance of Sanur over the years, and for all our friends who have known us as Art Cafe Warung & Spa we look forward to welcoming you to the new Art Cafe Sanur. Our Leha Leha Spa will be opening at a separate location on Jl. Sudamala, later in the year.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl. Danau Tamblingan, No. 82, in front of the Besakih Hotel and Jamu Traditional Spa. As With Art Cafe Warung & Spa, Art Cafe Sanur is open every day, serving all day breakfast from 7AM to 5PM, together with lunch from noon onwards, and dinner from 5 PM to 11PM. Happy Hours are from 4 to 6 PM. We also provide free Internet connections and Wi-fi. For visitors who have sampled the beauty and ambiance of Sanur over the years, and for all our friends who have known us as Art Cafe Warung & Spa we look forward to welcoming you to the new Art Cafe Sanur. Our Leha Leha Spa will be opening at a separate location on Jl. Sudamala, later in the year.

This little intimate Take away and Dine-in restaurant, with its rustic and beautiful plank tables and benches, has won critical acclaim for its juicy and crispy grilled chickens and Pork Spare ribs. In addition, a wide range of home made western salads and potato dishes. Our executive chef and owner for many years, Ni Ketut, ensures that our talented chefs use only fresh ingredients from the morning market. If local products do not meet our high quality standards, then we use imported raw materials such as Dairy products from France and olive oil from Italy or Spain. All meals are without MSG (Mono Sodium Glutamate). The kitchen is open every day from 12:00 until 21:00. We recommend booking of seats, take away or delivery.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl. Danau Tamblingan, No. 82, in front of the Besakih Hotel and Jamu Traditional Spa. As With Art Cafe Warung & Spa, Art Cafe Sanur is open every day, serving all day breakfast from 7AM to 5PM, together with lunch from noon onwards, and dinner from 5 PM to 11PM. Happy Hours are from 4 to 6 PM. We also provide free Internet connections and Wi-fi. For visitors who have sampled the beauty and ambiance of Sanur over the years, and for all our friends who have known us as Art Cafe Warung & Spa we look forward to welcoming you to the new Art Cafe Sanur. Our Leha Leha Spa will be opening at a separate location on Jl. Sudamala, later in the year.

This little intimate Take away and Dine-in restaurant, with its rustic and beautiful plank tables and benches, has won critical acclaim for its juicy and crispy grilled chickens and Pork Spare ribs. In addition, a wide range of home made western salads and potato dishes. Our executive chef and owner for many years, Ni Ketut, ensures that our talented chefs use only fresh ingredients from the morning market. If local products do not meet our high quality standards, then we use imported raw materials such as Dairy products from France and olive oil from Italy or Spain. All meals are without MSG (Mono Sodium Glutamate). The kitchen is open every day from 12:00 until 21:00. We recommend booking of seats, take away or delivery.

For two and one half years, we were located directly in front of the Mercure Hotel Sanur, in one of the peaceful and quiet neighbourhoods for which Sanur is well known. Unfortunately, at the end of July this year, we lost out lease, and were forced to relocate to a more uptown location on Jl. Danau Tamblingan, No. 82, in front of the Besakih Hotel and Jamu Traditional Spa. As With Art Cafe Warung & Spa, Art Cafe Sanur is open every day, serving all day breakfast from 7AM to 5PM, together with lunch from noon onwards, and dinner from 5 PM to 11PM. Happy Hours are from 4 to 6 PM. We also provide free Internet connections and Wi-fi. For visitors who have sampled the beauty and ambiance of Sanur over the years, and for all our friends who have known us as Art Cafe Warung & Spa we look forward to welcoming you to the new Art Cafe Sanur. Our Leha Leha Spa will be opening at a separate location on Jl. Sudamala, later in the year.
